# Questions Page

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Execute: `npm install`
4. Execute: `npm run dev`

The application will open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`

## Description

I made a web page that works as a section of a future page which is a section of frequently asked questions or faq. When a question is opened it closes a question that was open.

## Technologies used

1. Typescript
2. CSS3
3. HTML5
4. Vite
